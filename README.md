# ðŸ’¼ Job Analytics Portal - Internship Project

This repository contains all Tableau dashboards and task files developed as part of my internship. The project focuses on visualizing and analyzing job-related data to uncover insights using multiple filters, calculated fields, and visual elements.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The **Job Analytics Portal** project aims to explore and analyze comprehensive job market data using Tableau. It covers:

- Company details and sizes  
- Job preferences (like gender-based preference)  
- Salary ranges and job types  
- Qualification requirements  
- Work type and experience levels  
- Time-based filters and visibility controls

All visuals were developed in Tableau and embedded in a dashboard designed for interactive exploration.
